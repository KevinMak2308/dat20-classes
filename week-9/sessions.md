# Sessions

HTTP is stateless protocol. Each request is a new request. There is no state saved with that request. 

Sometimes we need to keep track of clients activity across multiple requests. The obvious result is a logged in user. 

Session management can be acheived through multiple ways:

- Cookies
- Hidden form fields
- URL rewriting
- `HttpSession`
