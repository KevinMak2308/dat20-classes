# Sessions

When developing web applications sometimes we need to store data for a user. That could fx be to save data for a logged in user. It could also be to store previous searches from a user like Google maps does. 

Now the problem with that is that HTTP is stateless. This means that there is no state stored in a request. Each request is a new request.



This problem is solved using sessions. Session management can be acheived multiple ways:

- [Cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)
- Hidden form fields
- URL rewriting
- `HttpSession`
